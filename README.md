# ADScript

**ADScript** is a lightweight Active Directory (AD) server implementation built with Node.js. It provides core AD functionalities, including user authentication, group management, and data replication.

---

## Features

-   **User Authentication:** Supports LDAP-based user authentication with SHA-256 password hashing.
-   **Group Management:** Manage group memberships and add users to groups seamlessly.
-   **Database Management:** Uses SQLite for efficient storage of user and group data.
-   **Backup Manager:** Create and manage database backups.
-   **Logging:** Integrates Winston for error tracking and combined logs.
-   **Testing:** Includes unit tests powered by Mocha for reliability.

```js
const config = {
    server: {
        host: process.env.AD_HOST || "localhost",
        port: parseInt(process.env.AD_PORT) || 3389,
        baseDN: process.env.AD_BASE_DN || "dc=mycompany,dc=com",
    },
    ldap: {
        timeout: parseInt(process.env.LDAP_TIMEOUT) || 30000,
        maxPageSize: parseInt(process.env.LDAP_MAX_PAGE_SIZE) || 1000,
    },
};

module.exports = config;
```

### Environment Variables
